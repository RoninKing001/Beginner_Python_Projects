This is a quick fun project to play flip the coin, Heads or Tails.
It's also designed to reinforce your knowledge on how to use the random module.

# Importing
import random
import string

"""

The string module in Python is a built-in module that provides a collection of string constants that can be useful 
for various tasks, including generating passwords. It's often used in conjunction with other modules like random to 
create random passwords.

Using this module makes it easy for you, so you don't have to create variables with all letter, digits and symbols.

In a later project I will include an updated version of the password generator that includes the secret module.
This module is better for password generators.
