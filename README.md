    Inside the main folder there is a list of beginner Python projects. 
    These are projects that I've done throughout the first month of programming.
    These were designed to reinforce what I've learned and built around my current knowledge.

<!-- ABOUT THESE PROJECTS -->
## About These Projects

These projects where / are part of the course 
I am currently undertaking and I thought it might be a good idea to add
these to `Github` for others that may be looking for some basic Python 
projects. Some of them where designed to be quite easy and others required 
a little more effort and research.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

These are projects that I have finished and can be used as a reference for
you to read through to help you with your own projects or if you'd like you 
can use them as a starter file and add more of your own code to make them 
more unique to you and what you might be looking for. 

To get started with these projects, you'll need to clone a copy of the project
to work on them on your own IDE. 

### How do I clone a copy of the project?

The easiest way to get a copy of the project is to go to the top of this repo
and click on the `< > Code` dropdown tab, and you should see a üìÅ download ZIP.
Click on that and save the zip file to a dedicated location.
Unzip the file, and you should be able to work on the files and 
make any adjustments you need. 

The second method of cloning the repo is to use the command line. I would 
recommend this way so that you get used to working with git and the command
line. Git is an important skill to learn and will help you in the future. 

<strong>Install Git:</strong> Before you can clone a repository from GitHub, 
you need to have Git installed on your computer. You can download and install 
Git from https://git-scm.com/ if you haven't already, or you can install Git
through your command line. 

1. Installing Git on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

* Open a terminal and use the following commands to install Git:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

2. Installing Git on Linux (Fedora):

* For Fedora-based Linux distributions, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

3. Installing Git on macOS:

* macOS users can install Git using Homebrew, a popular package manager. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it first by running:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
After installing Homebrew, you can install Git by running:

```bash
brew install git
```

4. Installing Git on Windows:

* To install Git on Windows, you can download and run the Git for Windows installer, which includes Git Bash (a Unix-like command line) and a GUI. Here are the steps:

* Visit the Git for Windows download page at https://gitforwindows.org/.
Download the installer.
Run the installer and follow the installation prompts. You can accept the default options unless you have specific preferences.
After completing these steps, Git should be installed on your system. You can verify the installation by opening a command prompt or terminal and running:

```bash
git --version
```
This command should display the installed Git version if the installation was successful.

<strong>Get the Repository URL:</strong> Go to the GitHub page of the 
repository you want to clone. You can find the repository's URL on the 
right-hand side of the page. Click the "Code" button, and then copy the URL 
that's displayed. It should look something like 
https://github.com/RoninKing001/repository-name.git.

<strong>Open Your Terminal:</strong> On your computer, open a terminal or 
command prompt. You'll use this to enter Git commands.

<strong>Navigate to the Directory:</strong> Use the cd (change directory) 
command to navigate to the location where you want to store the local copy 
of the repository. For example, to clone the repository into your Documents 
folder, you could use:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

Clone the Repository: Use the git clone command followed by the URL 
you copied earlier. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoninKing001/repository-name.git
```

Replace the URL with the one you obtained in step 2, and make sure there's 
no space between git and clone.

Authenticate (if necessary): If the repository is private or requires 
authentication, you'll be prompted to enter your GitHub username and 
password or a personal access token.

Wait for the Clone to Finish: Git will download the repository and create a 
local copy in the directory you specified. Once the process is complete, 
you'll see a message indicating that the clone was successful.
